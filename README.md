# A3-Modpack-Parser
Utility program for parsing through Arma 3 modpacks and finding unused mods that can be unsubscribed from the Steam Workshop.

## Installation guide for non-Github users
1. At the right hand side select the newest release to download
2. Unzip the files wherever you want.
3. Follow the user guide below.

## User guide
1. Gather all of your Arma 3 preset files currently in use (html files), and copy them into the /Presets/ folder inside the program.
2. Get a preset file that includes **all** mods you've currently subscribed to, and copy it into the /FullMods/ folder.
   - In the A3 launcher, go into the mods tab.
   - Press "More" above the list of mods.
   - Select "Export a list of mods to a file"
   - Select "All mods".
3. Run the program from the .exe file.
4. Find the 'unsubscribable.html' file generated in the programs folder, and import it to your A3 launcher.
5. You may unsubscribe all of the mods that the preset made active. None of them are used by the presets you added in step 1. Unsubscribe straight from the launcher by opening a mods details and pressing the garbage can icon.

Repeat all steps when you feel like you need to get rid of extra mods again :+1:
